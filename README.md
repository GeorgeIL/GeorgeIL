👋 Hi, I’m @GeorgeIL!

👀 I’m interested in coding and creating useful apps for my day-to-day life, with a goal of eventually making a positive impact on the world.

🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Lua, Python, HTML, and CSS.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finishing my school projects atm. :D

📫 Reach me via DM.

⚡ Fun fact: I love data and am always up for a game of poker!
